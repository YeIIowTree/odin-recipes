        <h2>Extra Info</h2>
        <p>Since tuna has mercury, I like to eat this only like 3 times a week, but I just do every other day cause I can't be bothered to keep a tally every week.</p>
        
        <h2>Rambling</h2>
        <p>I think this recipe is so good, I prefer it to real burgers but that might be blasphemous to some people. I love using some paprika, minced onion, and some pepper flakes in it. I've eaten it on bread before and honestly this recipe doesn't need it, it tasted better by itself. If you wanted to eat it like a sandwich you could but I've eaten it with and without bread and honestly it tastes better without. So eat and enjoy I guess, credit to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@scooby1961" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scooby1961</a> for the recipe. </p>
